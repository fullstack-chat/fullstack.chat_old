## Adding Your Profile  

If you are an active member on the server (more on that [here](https://www.notion.so/fullstackchat/fsc-bot-3f6ecd2d4ea440458b36504cbcd4a5f4)), you may add your profile to the site by forking the repository, updating src/data/profiles.json, and issuing a PR into the master branch. 

Note the following requirements;

- Copy the format of an existing profile and change the info.
- The PR should be named similary to "Adding {{name}}" or "Updating {{name}}".

Failure to follow these guidelines may result in the PR being rejected.
